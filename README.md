# Running the script
I am not familiar with running a JS script in the same fashion as a complied C program. Nevertheless, I have attached my script and it can be run using the following command from shell: $node t.js . Addtionaly, I have only imported txt files to JS using the "fs" package but we are required not to use any external libraries.

# Efficiency
Better efficiency could be acheived by forgowing the use of java date and replacing it with process related functions.

# Enhacements
The code can be enhanced by interacting with lower level hardware JS that I have not had the chance to work with.

# Question
JS reaches its limits in performing mainly because of its asynchronous nature.
